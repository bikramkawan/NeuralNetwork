{"name":"Ocean","tagline":"Realistic water shader for Three.js","body":"ocean - Realistic water shader for Three.js\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis project propose an implementation of a three.js shader to provide a realistic plane water effect.\r\nIt can be used to render water in some situations like complete ocean or small surface of water in real time.\r\n\r\n### Demos\r\n\r\n* [Demo](https://jbouny.github.io/ocean/demo/)\r\n* [Basic demo](https://jbouny.github.io/ocean/demo_basic/)\r\n* [Mobile control demo](https://jbouny.github.io/ocean/demo_mobile/)\r\n* [Fog and rotation demo](https://jbouny.github.io/ocean/demo_test/)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- Three.js r70 to render the scene : https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/\r\n- JQuery 1.10.2 as a helper : https://github.com/jquery/jquery\r\n- Terrain-generator for procedural terrain generation : https://github.com/jbouny/terrain-generator\r\n\r\n### Sources\r\n\r\n- Slayvin - http://slayvin.net\r\nUse of the flat mirror implementation for three.js as a base : https://code.google.com/p/mirror-three-js/source/browse/FlatMirror.js\r\n\r\n- Stemkoski - http://www.adelphi.edu/~stemkoski\r\nUse of the adaptation of the flat mirror implementation to provide a water effect\r\n\r\n- Jonas Wagner - http://29a.ch/\r\nThe real rendering come from here : http://29a.ch/slides/2012/webglwater, an explanation on how to render water. With some adaptation of its shader, results are here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Alt text](/screenshots/ocean1.jpg \"Example of a water rendering with an ocean\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
